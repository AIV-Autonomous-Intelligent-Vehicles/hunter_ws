## About Us
Welcome to the official repository of AIV (Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles), the self-driving car club at Sejong University.  

We are a passionate group of students from Sejong University dedicated to the field of autonomous driving. Our mission is to explore, learn, and innovate within the realm of self-driving technology.<br><br>
## Development Environment

- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS Version: ROS 1 Noetic
- Matlab: 2023a
<br><br>
## Simulation Environment

We have utilized the **hunter2** model provided by [agilexrobotics](https://github.com/agilexrobotics/ugv_gazebo_sim) as the foundation for our simulation environment. To enhance its capabilities, we have integrated the following sensors:

- GPS
- IMU
- Ouster 64-channel LiDAR
- Left, Right Camera<br>

### Future Enhancements for Real-World Implementation

While our primary focus is on the simulation environment, we are actively working towards implementing track driving in a real-world scenario. To achieve this, we are incorporating various sensors to enhance perception capabilities.   
You can find the additional files and information for the sensors intended for real-world use at the `~/hunter_ws/src/realworld` directory.
- GPS (**C099-F9P** with applied RTK correction signals)
- IMU (**Xsens mti-3 AHRS**)
- Lidar (**Ouster OS-1 64ch**)

## YOLOv5 Cone Detection and Path Planning

Our repository includes a built-in YOLOv5 model that has been trained to detect yellow and blue cones. Here's a deeper insight into our process:

- **Cone Detection with YOLOv5**: We trained the YOLOv5 model to detect both yellow and blue cones.

- **Lidar-Camera Calibration**:Post detection, we use lidar-camera calibration to cluster the detected regions of the cones.

- **Path Generation using Delaunay Triangulation**: We employ the Delaunay Triangulation method to generate an optimal path amongst the cones.

- **Path Tracking with Pure Pursuit**:The generated path is then tracked using the Pure Pursuit algorithm to ensure our vehicle follows the designated path while avoiding the cones.

### MATLAB Example Integration
We have also incorporated a MATLAB example that demonstrates the entire process â€“ from cone detection to path tracking. Interested users can access and run the example from `~/hunter_ws/matlab/TrackExample.m`.

## Getting Started

To begin with our project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install ROS Dependencies

Execute the following commands to install ROS dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y ros-noetic-ros-control ros-noetic-ros-controllers ros-noetic-gazebo-ros ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher-gui ros-noetic-rqt-robot-steering ros-noetic-hector-gazebo-plugins ros-noetic-ackermann-steering-controller -y
sudo apt install -y ros-noetic-cob-perception-msgs ros-noetic-cob-object-detection-msgs # for yolo
sudo apt install ros-noetic-mavros-msgs -y # for gps
sudo apt install sharutils -y # for imu
sudo apt install -y ros-noetic-pcl-ros ros-noetic-rviz ros-noetic-tf2-geometry-msgs # ouster lidar
sudo apt install -y build-essential libeigen3-dev libjsoncpp-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libspdlog-dev # ouster lidar
pip install --upgrade python-dateutil # for yolo
```
### 2. Install Hunter2 Model

Create the hunter_ws directory and install the Hunter2 model using the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/AIV-Autonomous-Intelligent-Vehicles/hunter_ws.git
```
### 3. Set Up Dependencies and Build
Install necessary dependencies and build the project using the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/hunter_ws
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
pip install -r ./src/simulation/yolov5_ros/src/yolov5/requirements.txt
sudo chmod 777 -R ./src/realworld/imu/xsens_ros_mti_driver
pushd ./src/realworld/imu/xsens_ros_mti_driver/lib/xspublic && make && popd 
chmod +x ./src/simulation/yolov5_ros/src/detect.py
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
catkin_make
```

### 4. Run Gazebo Simulation

```bash
# Gazebo
cd ~/hunter_ws
source devel/setup.bash

roslaunch hunter2_gazebo hunter2_main.launch
```
### 5. Matlab Example
`~/hunter_ws/matlab/TrackExample.m`
